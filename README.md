# Lexington

Lexington is a ticketing system built on a few concepts: Tickets, Devices,
Issues, Statuses, Schools, and Liabilities. It was a system to track Chromebook
issues I built for my high school's student-led IT team and was in daily use in
one form or another during both the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years.
